			<p class="p1">I'm a UX designer by day and a graduate student by night. This website started from a class
				assignment and ended up being something I enjoyed enough to continue bringing to life</p>
			<p class="p2">It's clearly still in progress, and I have pretty far to go but I am very proud of how far I've
				come. Most of my inspiration comes from my amazing friends - who are obsessed with board games -, Adobe's
				Creative Types Quiz and the beautiful illustrations from DmitryMo on iStock.</p>
			<h3 class="typeh33">What's to come?</h3>
			<p class="p2">An accurate quiz (not all combinations have been computed yet) and more in-depth information
				about each type, including game recommendations!</p>
